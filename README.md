In this assignment, I created some of the key components of a system that can plan which plane an airline uses to fly passengers on each of their flights, and choose which pilots and cabin crew are rostered for each flight. This is a simplified but representative version of a real problem faced by airlines and other businesses. The University has consulted with several businesses in other sectors in the region to develop this kind of software over recent years.
